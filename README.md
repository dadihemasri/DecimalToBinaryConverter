### üåü Decimal to Binary Converter

#### Overview üìú

Welcome to the Decimal to Binary Converter project! In this repository, we explore the fascinating world of recursion, a programming concept where a function calls itself. The primary objective is to build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. This project not only enhances your understanding of recursion but also provides insights into the call stack, all while visualizing the recursion process through an animation.

#### Project Highlights üöÄ

1. **Recursion Fundamentals**: Delve into the fundamentals of recursion, gaining a deep understanding of how a function can call itself to solve complex problems.

2. **Decimal-to-Binary Conversion**: The main goal is to create a converter capable of taking a decimal number as input and producing its binary representation.

3. **Visual Representation**: Through the use of animations, this project offers a visual representation of the recursion process. This adds a tangible layer to abstract concepts, aiding in a more comprehensive learning experience.

4. **SetTimeout Function**: Utilize the `setTimeout` function to create a step-by-step animation. This feature allows you to observe changes in the call stack, providing valuable insights into the recursion process.

5. **Call Stack Exploration**: Gain in-depth insights into the call stack, understanding its behavior during recursive function calls.

6. **Stack Methods**: Explore and employ stack-related methods to effectively manage the recursion process.
